# CSES Problemset Solutions
Some of my solutions (in Haskell, C++ and Java) to the CSES Competitive Programming Problem Set (found at https://cses.fi/problemset/list/).

These solutions have been accepted (passed all tests). 

## (Mainly Java) Solutions Disclaimer

The CSES submission platform requires that Java solutions consist of exactly one file, entitled "Solution.java". The Java solutions in this repository adhere to this unfortunate restriction. 

In fact, the one file restriction applies to all languages, so the C++ and Haskell solutions in this repository also concede to it.
