# CSES Problemset Solutions
Some of my solutions (in Haskell, C++ and Java) to the CSES problemset (found at https://cses.fi/problemset/list/).

These solutions have been accepted (passed all tests). 

## Java Solutions Disclaimer

The CSES submission platform requires that Java solutions consist of exactly one file, entitled "Solution.java". The Java solutions in this repository adhere to this unfortunate restriction.
