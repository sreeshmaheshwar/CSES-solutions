# CSES Problemset Solutions
Some of my solutions (in Haskell, C++ and Java) to the CSES problemset (found at https://cses.fi/problemset/list/).

These solutions have been accepted (passed all tests). 

Note that the CSES submission platform requires Java solutions to consist of exactly one file, entitled "Solution.java". Thus, the Java solutions in this repository adhere to this unfortunate restriction.
